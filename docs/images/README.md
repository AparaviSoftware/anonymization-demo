# Pipeline Images

## pipeline.png

This image shows the visual pipeline builder interface from Aparavi Console.

To add the actual image:
1. Save the pipeline visualization screenshot as `pipeline.png` in this directory
2. The image should show the complete pipeline flow from Web Hook → LlamaParse → Classification → Anonymization → HTTP Results

The visual pipeline builder allows you to:
- Drag and drop components
- Connect data flows between components
- Configure component settings
- Export pipeline configurations as JSON
- Test pipelines with sample data

## Adding Your Own Pipeline Images

When creating documentation for your custom pipelines:
1. Open the Aparavi Console
2. Design your pipeline in the visual builder
3. Take a screenshot of the complete pipeline
4. Save it in this directory with a descriptive name
5. Reference it in the main README or documentation
